# ðŸ”¢ Base Converter

A simple project to explore and learn the fundamentals of the Rust programming language by building a number base converter (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, etc).

This project helps me practice core Rust concepts like:

- `struct`s
- `trait`s
- Pattern matching
- Ownership and borrowing
- Error handling

It also gives me a deeper understanding of how base conversion works in theory and in practice.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Convert numbers between different bases: binary (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16)
- Simple CLI interface
- Written purely in Rust without external dependencies (if possible)

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Understand Rustâ€™s type system and memory model
- Practice implementing and using traits
- Work with string parsing and number manipulation
- Build small but complete Rust applications

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Clone the repository and run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/base-converter.git
cd base-converter
cargo run
